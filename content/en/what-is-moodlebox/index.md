MoodleBox is a standalone small and cheap mobile device working without Internet. It combines a wireless access point with a full featured Moodle server.

{{< figure src="/img/carousel/small-versatile.png" alt="MoodleBox creates a Wi-Fi network" width="550" class="right-aligned-image" >}} Turn on MoodleBox to create a wireless local area network and enable learners to connect to it using their own devices to retrieve documents, collaborate in real time and take complete training courses using [Moodle][1].

Connect the box to the Internet via a wired network (Ethernet) and in addition give learners access to the Internet.

### Technology

MoodleBox is [built][2] around a mini-computer [Raspberry Pi][3] 3A, 3B, 3B+ or 4B and the [Moodle learning environment][1], the most used open source LMS in the world.

### Use cases

MoodleBox used to enhance online learning and teaching:

  - where infrastructure is non-existent or inadequate, for example in developing countries;
  - where infrastructure has been destroyed, in the wake of war episodes or natural disasters;
  - when existing infrastructure is not suitable for specific projects, for example when the Internet speed is not fast enough or when the platform provided is not adapted to the usage you need (no plugins, no customization possible, etc.);
  - when it is sensible to provide learning activities offline, without Internet access.

It offers small groups (about 20-30 participants) the opportunity to work in a learning environment without the need for heavy setup.
