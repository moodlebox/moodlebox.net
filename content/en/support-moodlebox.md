### Where does your money go?

From September 2016 to December 27, 2018, the project MoodleBox collected 558€ in donations. This amount enabled the payment of hardware and the subscription fees for the domain names: moodlebox.net, moodlebox.org, moodlebox.me, moodlebox.fr, moodlebox.de and moodlebox.ch, as well as the web hosting subscription for just over one year.
