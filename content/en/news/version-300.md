  - It is based on Raspbian Buster, thanks to the [Raspbian Buster Lite image][4] published on July 10, 2019.
  - PHP was updated to version 7.3.
  - For maintenance purposes, the phpMyAdmin script to manage the Moodle database [has been replaced][6] by Adminer, a lighter tool [with the same features][7].
  - The deprecated [Moodle administrator account][9] _admin_ is no longer installed by default.

This version also provides a preliminary version of the MoodleBox update script. The script is functional, but no documentation is yet provided.
