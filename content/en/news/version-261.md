[Version 2.6.1][2] of the [MoodleBox disk image][1] is released today.

  - This release provides [Moodle][3] version 3.6.1, which fixes a bug in the instant messaging of Moodle.
  - It uses PHP version 7.0 again. Version 7.1 of PHP complicates update operations, preventing the development of an automatic update script for the MoodleBox.

{{< notice note >}}
Version 2.6.0 of the MoodleBox image, released on December 3, 2018, __cannot be automatically updated with the update script__ under development. We recommend that you use this version instead.
