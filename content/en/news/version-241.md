[Version 2.4.1][2] of the [MoodleBox disk image][2] is released today.

This version contains only small modifications, essentially:

  - The Wi-Fi access point channel is initially set to 11 instead of 13, to improve compatibility with some older devices;
  - A new version of the [MoodleBox plugin for Moodle][3] allows more reliable detection of the Raspberry Pi model used. In particular, the Zero W model is correctly recognized.

Other improvements have been made under the hood. See the [release notes on Github][2] for more info about all changes to this version.
