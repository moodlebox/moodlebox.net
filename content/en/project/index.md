{{< figure src="osi_standard_logo_0.png" alt="open source initiative logo" width="300px" class="right-aligned-image" >}}The MoodleBox project is a free (as in speech and in beer) and open source project.

### History

The idea of MoodleBox arose between january 2015 and spring 2016 in some forum discussions [in the french community][4] of [Moodle][1], when discussing about the construction of a [Moodle platform in a little box][12] or [on a local computer][5], to provide an LMS in regions without any network infrastructure. The [idea quickly emerged][6] to build it with a Raspberry Pi 3, and to make it accessible via Wi-Fi. Thanks to the perseverance of [Christian Westphal][7], a [first proof of concept][8] was proposed.

MoodleBox is a volunteer and non-profit project lead by [Nicolas Martignoni][2] on his spare time.
