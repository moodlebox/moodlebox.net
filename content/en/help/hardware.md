Here is the stuff you will need to build your MoodleBox:

  * [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+][5] or [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B][1],
  * High quality [Power supply][2],
  * [MicroSD card][3] of sufficient size; we recommend a capacity of 32 GB or more, even if MoodleBox can work with a smaller card size,
  * [Raspberry Pi case][4] (not essential, but very useful to protect the Raspberry Pi 3).

The total hardware amount is approximately USD 90, 80 € or CHF 90.

{{% notice warning %}}
Selecting a __good quality__ microSD card and an adequate power supply are __essential__ for the proper operation of the MoodleBox.

We recommend the [official Raspberry Foundation power supply](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/universal-power-supply/) and a microSD card with tested performance, for example [those recommended by Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-microsd-card/). The use of other power supplies, as well as microSD cards from dubious sources, can cause systematic malfunctions, for which __no support can be provided__.
