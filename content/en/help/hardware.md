Here is the stuff you will need to build your MoodleBox:

  * Any Raspberry Pi [4 Model B][RPi4B], [3 Model B+][RPi3Bplus], [3 Model B][RPi3B], [3 Model A+][RPi3Aplus], [Zero 2 W][RPiZero2W], [400][RPi400] or [5][RPi5],
  * A high quality power supply,
  * A microSD card of sufficient size; we recommend a capacity of 32 GB or more, even if MoodleBox can work with a smaller card size,
  * A Raspberry Pi case (not essential, but very useful to protect the Raspberry Pi).

The total hardware amount is approximately USD 90, 80â‚¬ or CHF 90.

{{< notice tip >}}
We recommend the [Raspberry Pi 12.5W Micro USB Power Supply](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-universal-power-supply/) for Raspberry Pi 3A+, 3B, 3B+ and Zero 2 W, the [Raspberry Pi 15W USB-C Power Supply](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/type-c-power-supply/) for Raspberry Pi 4B and 400 and the [Raspberry Pi 27W USB-C Power Supply](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/27w-power-supply/) for Raspberry Pi 5.

We also recommend a microSD card with __solid, tested performance__.

The use of other power supplies, as well as microSD cards from dubious sources, can cause systematic malfunctions, for which __no support can be provided__.
