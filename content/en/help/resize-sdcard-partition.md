### Steps to follow

{{< notice warning >}}
The operation described below is not required if you have downloaded the disk image from this website. However, it may be necessary to run it if you have received a custom disk image.
{{< /notice >}}

- [Copy your custom disk image][2] to the microSD card.
- [Start your MoodleBox][3] in the usual way.
- [Connect to the Moodle][4] of the MoodleBox using an administrator account. If MoodleBox user accounts have not been modified, use the [default login information][5].
- Access the [administration interface][6] of the MoodleBox ([Site Administration > Server > MoodleBox][6] in the administration block).
- Click on the button _Resize SD card partition_.

The MoodleBox restarts immediately and is ready for use seconds after this operation.

{{< notice info >}}
There is no problem clicking the _Resize SD card partition_ button when the SD card is already resized. The only consequence will be the restart of the MoodleBox.
