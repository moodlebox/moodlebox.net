### Change Wi-Fi network name (SSID)

You may change the network name (SSID). Type in a new SSID in the adequate field and click the button __Change Wi-Fi settings__. Starting with MoodleBox version 2.3.0, it is possible to enter SSIDs with specials characters such as emojis, including spaces.

{{< notice note >}}
SSID must be a string of at least 1 byte and at most 32 bytes. Remember that some characters, such as emojis, use more than one byte.

### Hide the Wi-Fi network

Starting with MoodleBox version 2.6.0, it is possible to hide the MoodleBox's Wi-Fi network by checking the __Hidden Wi-Fi Network__ box.

{{< notice tip >}}
When the Wi-Fi network is hidden, it is difficult to know that a MoodleBox is active in the area. Only enable this option if you are sure of what you are doing, as users will probably have more trouble finding the MoodleBox.

### Change Wi-Fi access point channel

To change the Wi-Fi channel of the wireless access point of the MoodleBox, select a channel number and click the button __Change Wi-Fi settings__.

### Change Wi-Fi regulatory country of the access point (from version 2.5.0)

To change the Wi-Fi regulatory country of the MoodleBox wireless access point, select a country from the drop-down list and click the __Change Wi-Fi settings__ button.

{{< notice info >}}
Authorized Wi-Fi channels depend on the country of regulation. Depending on the country selected, some channels will no longer be available.

### Remove Wi-Fi network password or change it

To enable a easier access of the Wi-Fi access point of the MoodleBox, it's possible to allow its access without a password. To do this, uncheck the __Wi-Fi network password protected__ checkbox. This can be rechecked at anytime.

It is also possible to change the password of the Wi-Fi access point of the MoodleBox. To do this, type in a new password in the adequate field. The password should be 8 to 63 characters long. If you fail to input a valid password, it will be reverted to the default password __moodlebox__.
