First [download balenaEtcher][2] (formerly known as _Etcher_), then follow the instructions in balenaEtcher to flash the __{{< ghrelease user="moodlebox" repo="moodlebox" data="file_name" >}}__ file [you've downloaded][1] on your microSD card.

### For the geeks

If you prefer to use a command line interface to flash your card: extract the __{{< ghrelease user="moodlebox" repo="moodlebox" data="file_name" >}}__ file [you've downloaded][1] and follow the [instructions][3] to copy the disk image __moodlebox-{{< ghrelease user="moodlebox" repo="moodlebox" data="version" >}}.img__ to your microSD card.
