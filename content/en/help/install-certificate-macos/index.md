To connect to the MoodleBox via HTTPS without displaying a warning window, it is necessary to install the MoodleBox root certificate (or CA certificate). This certificate, issued by the [MoodleBox project][project] as a certification authority, allows the browser to ensure that the certificate on the MoodleBox website is valid.

### Root certificate installation on macOS (Safari et Chrome)

1. Download the CA certificate from the [MoodleBox homepage][moodlebox] by clicking link _Install root CA certificate_. The file `moodleboxCA.crt` is saved in _Downloads_ folder of your computer.

2. Open folder _Downloads_ and double-click on file `moodleboxCA.crt` to save it in _Keychain Access_, either in the _session_ keychain or in the _System_ keychain. To make the certificate available to all computer users, choose the _System_ keychain.
4. In _Keychain Access_, select the keychain where you saved the certificate, then double-click certificate _MoodleBox Root CA_.
5. Expand section _Trust_.
6. Set option _When using this certificate_ to __Always trust__.
