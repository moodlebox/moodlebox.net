As a normal user, you should not need to connect into the command line interface of the MoodleBox. Anyway, you may access it if necessary via SSH, using the address __moodlebox.home__, using its default credentials:

  * username: __moodlebox__
  * password: __Moodlebox4$__

### With PuTTY (under Windows)

Open a new connection, type the address __moodlebox.home__ under _Host Name_, then click _Open_. Input the password __Moodlebox4$__.

### In a classical terminal interface

In your favorite terminal interface, type

```bash
ssh moodlebox@moodlebox.home
```

then type the password __Moodlebox4$__.

The hostname of the MoodleBox is __moodlebox__. Its fully qualified domain name (_FQDN_) is __moodlebox.home__.
