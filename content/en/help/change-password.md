{{< notice warning >}}
It is strongly recommended to __immediately change__ the main password of the MoodleBox, in order to prevent unauthorized persons from making unwanted changes and rendering it unusable.
{{< /notice >}}

To change the main password of your MoodleBox, visit the dashboard in the administration interface: [Site Administration > Server > MoodleBox][1].

This password is part of the main credentials of your MoodleBox. It gives access to the [command line interface][5] of the MoodleBox, to the [SFTP file upload][6]  as well as to the [database administration][7].

In the __MoodleBox password section__, enter your new password, the same in both fields. By clicking on the eye icon, you can display the characters you have typed. We recommend choosing a strong password.

{{< notice info >}}
The password for the Moodle administrator account __is not changed__ by this operation. To change that password, log in to Moodle, visit the <a href="http://moodlebox.home/user/preferences.php" target="_blank">preferences for your profile</a> and <a href="http://moodlebox.home/login/change_password.php" target="_blank">change the password</a>.
