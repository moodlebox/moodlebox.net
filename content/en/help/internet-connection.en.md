When connected with a cable to an Ethernet network which gives access to the Internet, the MoodleBox acts as a router and provides Internet access to all devices that are wirelessly connected to it.

When this is not desired, simply remove the Ethernet cable from the MoodleBox during the period when Wi-Fi Internet access should not be provided.

Have a look at the [MoodleBox network topology][1] for more information about this.
