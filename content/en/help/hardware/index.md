Here is the stuff you will need to build your MoodleBox:

  * Raspberry Pi [4 Model B][RPi4B], [3 Model B+][RPi3Bplus], [3 Model B][RPi3B] or [3 Model A+][RPi3Aplus],
  * High quality [Power supply][supply],
  * [microSD card][sdcard] of sufficient size; we recommend a capacity of 32 GB or more, even if MoodleBox can work with a smaller card size,
  * [Raspberry Pi case][case] (not essential, but very useful to protect the Raspberry Pi).

The total hardware amount is approximately USD 90, 80 € or CHF 90.

{{< notice tip >}}
Selecting a __good quality__ microSD card and an adequate power supply are __essential__ for the proper operation of the MoodleBox.

We recommend the [Raspberry Pi 12.5W Micro USB Power Supply](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/micro-usb-power-supply/) for Raspberry Pi 3A+, 3B, 3B+ and Zero 2 W, and [Raspberry Pi 15W USB-C Power Supply](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/type-c-power-supply/) for Raspberry Pi 4B, and a microSD card with tested performance, for example [those recommended by Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-microsd-card/). The use of other power supplies, as well as microSD cards from dubious sources, can cause systematic malfunctions, for which __no support can be provided__.
