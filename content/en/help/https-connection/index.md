The procedure below can be used to configure the MoodleBox to provide secure connections via HTTPS. Once this is done, __it will no longer be possible to connect via HTTP__.

1. Access [MoodleBox command line interface][ssh-connect] (via SSH).
2. Edit file `/var/www/moodle/config.php`, e.g. typing command `nano /var/www/moodle/config.php`.
3. Change line beginning with `$CFG->wwwroot`, replacing `http://` by `https://` in address `http://moodlebox.home`.
4. Save the modification.
5. Test by loading URL https://moodlebox.home in your favorite browser.

{{< notice warning >}}
Once the configuration is completed, devices connecting via HTTPS will see a warning window indicating that the MoodleBox certificate is not valid. To remove this warning, __each device__ must install the MoodleBox root certificate.

### Installing the root certificate on client devices

To connect to the MoodleBox via HTTPS without displaying a warning window, it is necessary to install the MoodleBox root certificate (or CA certificate). This certificate, issued by the [MoodleBox project][project] as a certification authority, allows the browser to ensure that the certificate on the MoodleBox website is valid.

The installation of the CA certificate depends on the browser and operating system.
