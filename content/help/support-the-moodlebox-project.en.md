The project MoodleBox tries to meet the needs of users without requiring any financial compensation. However, the development and maintenance of the MoodleBox, the building of the disk image, the writing of the documentation and its hosting on a web site are not free.

A contribution allows to participate in the costs for the hosting of the website. It boosts and increases the motivation to continue the work on the project MoodleBox.

As of march 31, 2018, the project MoodleBox collected 326€ in donations. This amount enabled the payment of the subscription fees for the domain names: moodlebox.net, moodlebox.org, moodlebox.me, moodlebox.fr, moodlebox.de and moodlebox.ch, as well as the web hosting subscription for just over one year.
