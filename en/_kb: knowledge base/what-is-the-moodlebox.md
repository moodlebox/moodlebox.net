The MoodleBox is a small footprint ubiquitous device, Internet independent, providing a wireless network for your smartphone, tablet or computer. It provides a complete <a href="https://moodle.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moodle</a> learning management system platform, enabling to supply online learning activities and sharing files with your users.

When connected to the Internet via a wired network (Ethernet), the MoodleBox also provides Internet access to devices connected to it via Wi-Fi.

It is <a href="https://moodlebox.net/en/help/hardware-needed/">built</a> around a mini-computer <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raspberry Pi 3</a> and the <a href="https://moodle.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moodle learning environment</a>, the most used open source LMS in the world.
<h3>The MoodleBox project</h3>
The MoodleBox project is a free (as speech and beer) project. The idea of MoodleBox arose in spring 2016 in a forum discussion <a href="https://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of the french community of Moodle</a>, when discussing about the construction of a <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=318719" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moodle platform on a local computer</a>, to provide an LMS in regions without any network infrastructure. The <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=330291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">idea quickly emerged</a> to build it with a Raspberry Pi 3, and to make it accessible via Wi-Fi. Thanks to the perseverance of <a href="http://moodlebox.tuxfamily.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Westphal</a>, a <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=331170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first proof of concept</a> was proposed.

The MoodleBox project is made by <a href="https://twitter.com/nmartignoni" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicolas Martignoni</a> on his spare time.
